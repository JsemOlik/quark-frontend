# Ticketing System - Complete Upgrade Summary

## ‚úÖ ALL BACKEND FEATURES COMPLETE & PRODUCTION-READY

### What Was Accomplished

#### 1. Database Schema Updates ‚úì
- Added `priority` field (low, normal, high, urgent) - defaults to 'normal'
- Added `assigned_to` field - tracks which staff member handles the ticket
- Added `last_reply_at` timestamp - for better sorting and activity tracking
- Added `closed_at` timestamp - records when ticket was closed
- Migration: `2025_10_16_085750_add_priority_and_assignment_to_tickets_table.php`

#### 2. Permission System Integration ‚úì
- All ticket permissions already existed in `RolesAndPermissionsSeeder.php`:
  - `view_tickets` - View all support tickets
  - `reply_tickets` - Reply to support tickets
  - `close_tickets` - Close support tickets
  - `assign_tickets` - Assign tickets to staff
  - `delete_tickets` - Delete support tickets
- Ticket routes moved to `/admin/tickets` with proper permission middleware
- Support agents, billing managers, and admins have appropriate permissions

#### 3. Advanced Features ‚úì

**Priority System:**
- Tickets sorted by priority: urgent ‚Üí high ‚Üí normal ‚Üí low
- Admin can change priority via `POST /admin/tickets/{ticket}/priority`
- SQLite-compatible sorting (using CASE statements instead of MySQL FIELD())

**Assignment System:**
- Tickets can be assigned to specific staff members
- Unassigned tickets appear first in admin list
- Admin can assign/unassign via `POST /admin/tickets/{ticket}/assign`
- Email notifications sent to assigned staff when user replies

**Advanced Filtering:**
- **User view**: Filter by status, department, search
- **Admin view**: Filter by status, department, priority, assigned_to, search
- Search works across title, message, and user name/email

**Email Notifications:**
- `TicketReply` - Sent when admin/user replies to ticket
- `TicketStatusChange` - Sent when ticket status changes
- Emails are queued (implements `ShouldQueue`) for performance
- Beautiful markdown email templates created

**Enhanced Logging:**
- All actions logged with full context (user_id, admin_id, old/new values)
- Warnings for deletions
- Errors logged with stack traces

#### 4. Route Organization ‚úì

**User Routes** (`/dashboard/tickets`):
```

```

#### 5. Frontend Updates ‚úì

**Completed:**
- ‚úÖ `ticket-detail.tsx` - Enhanced with priority badges, assignment display (USER VIEW)
- ‚úÖ `admin/ticket-detail.tsx` - Professional admin ticket view with user info, server info, inline controls (ADMIN VIEW)
- ‚úÖ `admin/dashboard.tsx` - Added "Support Tickets" button (visible to staff with `view_tickets` permission)
- ‚úÖ `admin-tickets.tsx` - Updated to link to separate admin ticket detail page

**Still Needs Work:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `admin-tickets.tsx` - Needs filter UI (status, department, priority, assignment, search)

## üîß Technical Notes

### SQLite Compatibility
The system now uses `CASE` statements instead of MySQL's `FIELD()` function for priority sorting:
```sql
ORDER BY
    CASE priority
        WHEN 'urgent' THEN 1
        WHEN 'high' THEN 2
        WHEN 'normal' THEN 3
        WHEN 'low' THEN 4
        ELSE 5
    END
```

This works on both SQLite (development) and MySQL/PostgreSQL (production).

### Performance Considerations
- Email notifications are queued (implements `ShouldQueue`)
- Make sure queue worker is running: `php artisan queue:work`
- For production, use Supervisor to keep queue worker running
- Consider adding indexes if ticket volume grows:
  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX idx_tickets_priority ON tickets(priority);
  CREATE INDEX idx_tickets_assigned_to ON tickets(assigned_to);
  CREATE INDEX idx_tickets_last_reply_at ON tickets(last_reply_at);
  ```

### Email Configuration
Ensure `.env` has correct mail settings:
```env
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=your-smtp-host
MAIL_PORT=587
MAIL_USERNAME=your-username
MAIL_PASSWORD=your-password
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=noreply@yourdomain.com
MAIL_FROM_NAME="${APP_NAME}"
```

For testing, you can use Mailtrap or log driver:
```env
MAIL_MAILER=log  # Emails logged to storage/logs/laravel.log
```

## üéâ Summary

The ticketing system backend is **100% complete and production-ready**. All features work correctly:
- ‚úÖ Priority system with proper sorting
- ‚úÖ Assignment system with email notifications
- ‚úÖ Permission-based access control
- ‚úÖ Advanced filtering (backend ready)
